# Aerobatic Instrument Suite

This app aims at creating flight instruments for airplanes that do not have onboard instruments using the sensors embedded in our mobile devices.  This app is currently configured to be used on an iPad.  Currently supporting pitch rate, roll rate, yaw rate, Gs in the X-axis, and Direction of gravity in the x and y axises.  This is mainly being developed for aerobatic use.  

## Main Screen

The app currently has one screen where all the instruments are displayed.  Pitch rate in the upper left hand corner.  Roll Rate in the lower left hand corner.  Yaw rate in the lower right hand corner. Gs in the upper right hand corner.  The two center instruments are two sides of the same instrument which shows the direction of gravity.  One when the plane is right side up and the other when it is upside down.
